# Autonomous Polymorphic Agent (APA)

## Project Overview

The Autonomous Polymorphic Agent (APA) is a cutting-edge, self-healing, and decentralized agent platform designed for robust, secure, and autonomous operation across diverse environments. Inspired by the need for resilient and adaptable systems, APA aims to provide a highly available and secure foundation for distributed applications and services.

Our vision is to create an agent that can autonomously discover peers, adapt to changing network conditions, self-heal from failures, and securely manage its own lifecycle, including module updates and policy enforcement. The platform is built with a strong emphasis on modern networking paradigms, cryptographic security, and extensibility through a modular architecture.

## Current Implemented Features

As of the latest development, the APA agent includes the following core functionalities:

### 1. Core Agent Runtime
- **Lifecycle Management:** Robust startup and graceful shutdown procedures.
- **Configuration:** Loads configuration from `agent-config.yaml`.
- **Logging:** Structured logging using `slog`.
- **Persistent Identity:** Generates and persists a unique cryptographic identity (Ed25519 key pair) for the agent, ensuring consistent peer identification across restarts.

### 2. Decentralized P2P Networking
- **libp2p Integration:** Utilizes `libp2p` for all peer-to-peer communication.

## Architecture

The APA agent's architecture is designed for modularity, security, and resilience, drawing inspiration from the detailed blueprint in `APA.md`. At its core, the agent is a small, compiled binary responsible for identity, secure networking (libp2p), module management (WASM), health monitoring, update orchestration, and an administrative API. Decentralized controllers and modules extend its functionality, operating within a sandboxed environment and adhering to strict policy enforcement.
